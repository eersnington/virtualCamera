# Virtual Camera
## A python application that uses OpenCV lib and IP Webcam app to convert your phone into a portable Webcam

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/eersnington/virtualCamera)


## What does it do?

For online classes, I found it difficult to use teams/zoom for online classes on my phone cause I don't have a webcam for my computer, so I found a way to use my phone as a webcam.

## Installation

Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eersnington/virtualCamera.git

```
Change directory and install OpenCV
```sh
cd virtualCamera
pip3 install opencv-python
```
Now install IP Webcam in your mobile phone.
